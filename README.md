## You need to answer the following question. 
Two binary search trees contains exactly the same number of entries of student information but in different orders.
Do they give the same performance in terms of key searching or firstname searching? if not, why? use the data you obtain from you code to 
explain your answer. 

ANSWER: No the performance isn't the same, because one of them wasn't balance. The list of name in datafile1 when added to the tree is right side unbalance therefore took more steps than the datafile2 list of name. The datafile2 which is already sorted, so that it took the path of what a balanced tree would have taken.
